## Spatiotemporal_Cox_Hawkes
This code allows you to do inference on self-exciting point processes with inhomogeneous backgrounds and spatial covariates. It is based on code from [1]. The trained decoders and encoder/decoder functions are provided by Dr Elisaveta Semenova following the proposals in [2]. 

## Usage

See ```demo.ipynb``` for a demo.
